As a fan of Rick and Morty, I really enjoyed working on this task. It was fun to dive into the API and see all the character details while implementing the widget. The connection between the technical assignment and a popular show made the task both engaging and motivating.

The instructions were clear, and the provided resources, including the Figma design and API documentation, were very helpful in understanding the task requirements.

This assignment struck a great balance between being challenging and enjoyable. I appreciated the opportunity to work with modern tools like EmotionJS and the React Context API, which made it feel like a practical, real-world project.

Thank you for designing such a fun and unique task!
